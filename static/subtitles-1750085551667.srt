00:03,552 --> 00:07,551
Hello everybody! This is Madhavi from Dhavi Creations!

2
00:07,551 --> 00:13,955
Many have been asking me to take Fabric Painting classes, workshops and online classes

3
00:13,955 --> 00:20,400
That's why I decided to make videos with complete details about Fabric Painting.

4
00:20,399 --> 00:23,399
To everyone who has been waiting for my videos and to those who have been following

5
00:23,399 --> 00:28,219
my videos and supporting me, I thank you very much! 🙏 

6
00:29,544 --> 00:34,801
Let's have a look at all the material you will need to start your fabric painting journey.

7
00:34,801 --> 00:37,015
This is our Fabric Painting Kit.

8
00:37,015 --> 00:41,015
We built this kit by collecting all of the items you will need as a one-stop shop -

9
00:41,015 --> 00:44,783
so that you can easily and quickly begin practicing your art.

10
00:44,783 --> 00:48,932
So today, we will learn about all of these items in detail and -

11
00:48,932 --> 00:53,454
we will then see a demo on how to use them to make our paintings 

12
00:58,066 --> 01:05,081
This is a list of all the items you will find in the fabric painting kit.

13
01:05,081 --> 01:12,013
These are instructions to transfer designs onto your cloth

14
01:18,237 --> 01:21,237
These are white and yellow carbon papers

15
01:22,587 --> 01:26,905
This, is a large tracing paper sheet

16
01:30,858 --> 01:33,014
And, printed designs.

17
01:33,014 --> 01:37,793
These include simple to detailed designs. 

18
01:37,793 --> 01:45,399
We will see the process of transferring these designs later in the demo

19
01:54,682 --> 02:00,513
This is a 6 inch embroidery ring. This is sufficient for practice.

20
02:00,659 --> 02:04,903
This is paper tape. We will need it when transferring the design.

21
02:04,903 --> 02:07,903
We will see how to, in the demo.

22
02:09,490 --> 02:14,263
Here are three commonly used paint brushes.

23
02:14,263 --> 02:21,371
and a ball point pen and a sketch pen we will need for design tracing and transferring.

24
02:21,792 --> 02:29,469
These are a few stones for practice, used in tanjore style painting

25
02:29,467 --> 02:34,570
 This is a small painting palette, used for colour mixing

26
02:34,569 --> 02:40,950
This is a half meter semi-raw silk cloth so that you can practice immediately.

27
02:40,949 --> 02:47,489
We will learn about cloth choices for our fabric painting projects in the next video.

28
02:50,495 --> 02:54,973
These are 9 commonly used acrylic paints.

29
02:54,973 --> 03:00,199
We included Flesh Tint / skin colour, which is used for faces and figurative paintings

30
03:00,199 --> 03:06,324
And Pearl Metallic Gold colour used for Tanjore Style Fabric Painting

31
03:06,324 --> 03:10,441
This is Pearl Metallic Gold 3D outliner. 

32
03:10,441 --> 03:17,129
We will use this to enhance our designs and for Tanjore Style paintings.

33
03:17,681 --> 03:21,680
And we also provide a Fabric Medium 1

34
03:21,680 --> 03:27,353
This is usually used for thinning the paint when it gets dry or thick

35
03:27,788 --> 03:30,093
I have to tell you a little detail now.

36
03:30,092 --> 03:36,114
In the market we find two types of paint - Acrylic colours and Fabric colours 

37
03:36,114 --> 03:40,728
Many are commonly confused on what paint they should choose

38
03:40,728 --> 03:48,129
These paints with the blue cap are softer and are made specifically for fabric painting, 

39
03:48,127 --> 03:52,531
But with only a little difference, both paints work the same way.

40
03:52,531 --> 03:58,417
I have been using Acrylic colours for many years now and I have faced no problems

41
03:58,417 --> 04:02,040
Even if there is an issue, it must be because of the cloth and not the paint.

42
04:02,038 --> 04:09,764
So you can freely use whatever paint is available to you without any doubt.

43
04:12,169 --> 04:16,564
First step, we should transfer the design on to the cloth.

44
04:16,564 --> 04:20,413
These are yellow and white carbon papers.

45
04:20,413 --> 04:23,413
You should only use these two types of carbon papers

46
04:23,413 --> 04:26,413
Never use blue or black carbon papers

47
04:26,413 --> 04:31,930
Because their colour can spread and cloth, painting both can get spoiled

48
04:31,930 --> 04:36,266
For our white colour cloth, we will use yellow carbon paper

49
04:36,266 --> 04:40,646
For dark colour cloth, you can use white carbon paper.

50
04:40,889 --> 04:45,019
Now we will transfer this lotus design on to our cloth

51
04:45,019 --> 04:48,019
Because the design is already on a white paper, 

52
04:48,019 --> 04:52,350
we can directly transfer the design directly by using the carbon paper under it.

53
04:54,610 --> 04:57,610
To prevent the design from moving,

54
04:57,610 --> 05:03,550
we will use paper tape to secure the design to the cloth

55
05:03,550 --> 05:06,550
If the design paper moves, you may draw double lines

56
05:06,550 --> 05:09,550
which can confuse you later, while you're painting

57
05:09,980 --> 05:14,018
After you secure the design to the cloth and set the carbon paper, 

58
05:14,018 --> 05:18,254
draw the design with a ball-point pen

59
05:21,730 --> 05:25,887
Make sure you draw the complete design without drawing double lines

60
05:29,992 --> 05:31,992
Before removing the paper tape, 

61
05:31,992 --> 05:36,086
You must confirm that the complete design is transferred

62
05:36,086 --> 05:42,175
Draw any missing lines and only then you should remove the paper tape

63
05:43,923 --> 05:48,673
Now we will see how to transfer a design using a tracing paper

64
05:52,761 --> 05:56,971
You should first cut the tracing paper to the size of the design

65
05:56,971 --> 06:02,326
Then stick it to the design paper with paper tape to prevent it from moving

66
06:07,591 --> 06:13,286
Now carefully trace the design on the tracing paper with a sketch pen

67
06:25,300 --> 06:32,620
After tracing the design, remove the tracing paper along with the tape

68
06:37,754 --> 06:42,932
Now stick this on our cloth where we want to transfer the design

69
06:42,932 --> 06:47,029
and set our carbon paper between them like this.

70
06:51,476 --> 06:54,476
To be able to see the design clearly, and to prevent the tracing paper and

71
06:54,475 --> 07:01,470
carbon paper from tearing, I am placing a white paper between them.

72
07:01,470 --> 07:07,057
This is optional. You can transfer the design even without the white paper.

73
07:35,355 --> 07:37,875
Now we will see how to setup this embroidery ring

74
07:37,875 --> 07:41,875
First set the inner ring behind the cloth with our transferred design

75
07:41,875 --> 07:48,504
Then, loosen the screw of the outer ring and fix it over the inner ring.

76
07:53,437 --> 07:56,437
Do not tighten the screw fully yet. Tighten it slowly,

77
07:56,437 --> 08:01,360
as you gently pull the cloth from the edges until all wrinkles are gone.

78
08:02,658 --> 08:08,041
As you pull the cloth, make sure the thread lines are straight

79
08:08,040 --> 08:12,949
If you pull the cloth too much, or if the thread lines are not straight,

80
08:12,949 --> 08:17,281
there’s a chance the painting turns out crooked after you remove the ring.

81
08:17,281 --> 08:23,420
You should only tighten the screw fully after you neatly set the cloth.

82
08:34,086 --> 08:37,086
These are the three brushes provided in the kit.

83
08:37,086 --> 08:44,139
This is a No. 1 round brush. It can be used for filling and even outlines.

84
08:44,139 --> 08:51,696
This is a No. 00 round brush. This is used for outlines and small details.

85
08:53,591 --> 09:00,437
This is a No. 1 flat brush. This is used for colour filling and blending.

86
09:01,096 --> 09:03,019
To clean the brushes as we paint, 

87
09:03,019 --> 09:08,995
we should have a container of water and a cotton cloth ready.

88
09:09,649 --> 09:12,649
Let's start painting now.

89
09:12,649 --> 09:15,686
To first put a base coat, I'm using white colour 

90
09:15,686 --> 09:22,158
and filling this lotus petal with a No. 1 flat brush.
